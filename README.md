## AR Advertising

**Problem Statement** : Pointing your camera towards a specific object (e.g. a still poster) generates an animation or plays a video and turn what is otherwise a lifeless ad into an immersive one. Using the accelerometer, the animation or video follows the movement of your device no matter how you hold it.

### Readme

This repository contains the source code and screenshot of demo website and app that we have said in the solution approach. This is not the fully working solution. This repository is made in support of the proof of our idea that AR can be implemented using open source libraries. There are front-end and back-end integrations which needs to be done (will be done before the finale).
